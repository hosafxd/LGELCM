      "Report: There is prominent heterogeneous T1 hypo and T2 hyperintense signal within the left femoral head and neck. There is subchondral T2 hypointense signal within the posterosuperior aspect of the left femoral head. There is no collapse or disruption of the articular surface. There is a multilobulated T1 and T2 heterogeneous region within the marrow of the proximal left femoral diaphysis measuring 2.2 cm AP x 5.5 cm CC x 1.9 cm TRV. This finding demonstrates serpiginous margins and is surrounded by marrow edema. There is a small left hip effusion. The remainder of the marrow signal demonstrates normal fat signal. There is no evidence of a discrete fracture or osseous lesion. Dedicated imaging of the left hip is somewhat suboptimal secondary to patient motion. There is mild osseous spurring along the superolateral margin of the left acetabulum. There is however no gross evidence of a labral tear or articular cartilage loss. The tendon origins and insertions on the pelvis are normal in appearance.\n",

      "Report: Direct comparison is made to prior examination dated ___. Again, bilateral areas of pleural calcification identified. This suggests prior asbestos exposure. Also, areas of interstitial thickening are identified at the lung bases. This may represent early pulmonary fibrosis. As on prior examination, there are small hyperattenuating foci seen within the liver parenchyma on images # 7 of series 3 as well as image 4 of series 3. Though the small lesion adjacent to the IVC is not as clearly seen on the current study. Stable hypoattenuating lesion is seen within the left lobe of the liver which is too small to characterize but likely represents a simple cyst. Several gallstones are seen. Stable left adrenal nodules are noted. The right adrenal gland, spleen, pancreas appear unremarkable. The kidneys are grossly unremarkable. Scattered atherosclerotic disease is seen. Again there is a left common iliac artery aneurysm. When compared to the aforementioned prior exam, this has increased in size slightly, measuring 3.3 x 4 cm on the current study versus 3.4 x 3.7 cm previously. Diverticulosis is noted throughout the descending and sigmoid colon. Bowel is otherwise grossly unremarkable. Enlargement of the prostate gland is again seen with areas of lower attenuation, which do appear grossly unchanged in size since the prior study. Fat-containing left inguinal hernia is incidentally noted. No suspicious lytic or blastic bony lesions are identified. Areas of sclerosis are again seen within the sacrum, unchanged since several prior CT scans.\n",

There is persistent effacement of the sulci, and mild mass effect with approximately 1.5 mm of midline shifting towards the left (image 13, series 9). This collection measures approximately 44 mm in length, with heterogeneous signal in all the sequences suggesting a chronic subdural collection no diffusion abnormalities are detected to indicate acute or subacute ischemic changes. On the left cerebral hemisphere and towards the convexity the sulci are slightly prominent suggesting mild cortical volume loss, likely age related and involutional in nature. The major vascular flow voids are present and demonstrate normal distribution. The orbits are unremarkable, the paranasal sinuses, middle ear cavities and mastoid air cells are clear.\n",

      "Report: This is a partially limited examination due to motion artifacts, there is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage, mass, mass effect, or shifting of the normally midline structures. The ventricles and sulci are prominent, likely age related and involutional in nature. The T2 and FLAIR sequences, demonstrate few scattered foci of high signal intensity in the subcortical white matter, which are nonspecific and may reflect chronic microangiopathic changes. No diffusion abnormalities are detected to suggest acute or subacute ischemic changes. There is no evidence of abnormal enhancement. The orbits demonstrate post-surgical changes, related with lens replacement bilaterally, the paranasal sinuses are normally pneumatized as well as the mastoid air cells.\n",

      "Report: Since the prior MRI, there has been the interval development of a 12-mm round lesion in the L3 vertebral body which is low signal on the T1-weighted images and the T2-weighted images, bright on STIR, and which demonstrates enhancement. On the recent CT, this is noted to be sclerotic. The lesion abuts the posterior cortex without evidence of cortical destruction or associated epidural mass. It is located at the same level as the retroperitoneal mass abutting the aorta, which has been previously described in the recent CT report. Vertebral body height remains intact, as does sagittal alignment. The conus terminates at L1. There remains normal signal within the conus medullaris and the cauda equina. There is no abnormal enhancement within the thecal sac after gadolinium administration. Multilevel degenerative disease is unchanged compared to the ___ study, worst at L5-S1. In the left paraaortic region, there are now prominent lymph nodes measuring 11 x 12 mm and 10 x 10 mm at the L2-L3 level, which were not as large on the recent CT. The retroperitoneal mass abutting the aorta is not entirely included on the imaged volume, and comparison for change is difficult. There are tiny right renal cysts.\n",

      "Report: The study is compared with the most recent MR examination of the cervical spine, dated ___ there is no cranial imaging on record. There is a relatively large T1-hypointense region, involving and expanding the midline calvarial diploe, which likely represents marrow replacement due to the patient's known multiple myeloma. No similar process is seen to involve the skull base or the included upper cervical spine, which demonstrates degenerative disease and abnormal alignment with hyperlordosis, which does not appear significantly changed overall. There is prominence of the cortical sulci and fissures with somewhat disproportionate ventricular dilatation, left more than right, likely representing preferential central atrophy superimposed on congenital/developmental ventricular asymmetry. While there is also medial temporal lobar atrophy, this does not appear disproportionate (on the coronal MP-RAGE sequence). There is also fairly marked prominence of the ___ spaces, particularly in the basal ganglia, bilaterally, representing the so-called `` etat crible'' associated with preferential central atrophy on a vascular `` starvation'' basis. There are scattered both discrete and confluent T2-/FLAIR-hyperintense foci in bihemispheric subcortical and periventricular white matter, likely the sequelae of chronic small vessel ischemic disease. There is no focus of slow diffusion to suggest an acute ischemic event and the principal intracranial vascular flow-voids, including those of the dural venous sinuses, are preserved. There is no space-occupying lesion, and the sella, parasellar region, and remainder of the skull base and orbits are unremarkable. There is only minor mucosal thickening involving the anterior ethmoidal air cells, bilaterally, with otherwise clear included paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells.\n",

The right occipital lobe lesion, has pre-contrast T1 hyperintense appearance and areas of negative susceptibility related to the blood products. There is no change in the appearance of the restricted diffusion in this lesion, which is confirmed to the presence of blood products. Comparing the pre and the post-contrast images, there is subtle enhancement in this area which is unchanged. No other areas of abnormal enhancement are noted. No new lesions are noted. The ventricles and extra-axial CSF spaces are mildly prominent, more so with the ventricles, likely related to parenchymal volume loss and unchanged.\n",

      "Report: The aorta demonstrates no evidence of intramural hematoma or dissection. The pulmonary arteries demonstrate no filling defects down to the subsegmental level. A left-sided Port-A-Cath is seen with its tip in the right atrium. There is confluent hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy. This is slightly increased from prior study. An endobronchial stent is noted in the right main stem bronchus and two stents are noted in the left main stem bronchus. Just beyond the left distal stent, there is severe stenosis of the left main stem bronchus secondary to mass effect from the surrounding lymphadenopathy and/or mass. Additionally, the superior subsegment of the left lower lobe bronchus is no longer patent. The superior left pulmonary vein is severely narrowed due to the same mass effect. Bilateral pleural effusions are seen with underlying atelectasis. Additionally, multiple spiculated nodular opacities are seen throughout all lung fields consistent with previously described pulmonary metastatic disease. Compared to the prior study, there are new nodular opacities. Within the right posterior lateral chest wall, there is a 37 x 23-mm enhancing soft tissue mass that appears to have arisen from an expansile lesion of the right sixth rib. Additionally, in the vertebral body of T3 there is a lucent lesion with a rim of sclerosis that does not have the typical appearance for metastatic lesion, but it was not present in prior study from ___ and has been growing in size since ___.\n",

      "Report: The aorta and its major branch vessels are patent, with no evidence of stenosis, occlusion, dissection, or aneurysmal formation. There is no evidence of penetrating atherosclerotic ulcer or aortic arch atheroma present. The pulmonary arterial tree is well opacified. There is interval improvement in the bilateral pulmonary emboli since the prior study. Thrombus in the right main pulmonary artery is decreased, and while thrombus extends into the right upper lobe pulmonary artery, there is now all pseudo about the thrombus and the areas flow more distally in right upper lobe branches, which was not present on the prior study. In the right middle lobe, there is also improvement in distal flow. Thrombus remains at the origin of the right lower lobe pulmonary, but there is no thrombus distally, and the right lower lobe pulmonary arteries are patent. The left upper lobe pulmonary artery has thrombus at the origin, but there is no fluid around the thrombus, and distally the branches are patent. Thrombus in the left upper lobe artery supplying the lingula appears similar to prior. In the left lower lobe, thrombus which was present in a medial branch is now cleared. The main pulmonary artery is stable in size. A right internal jugular approach central venous catheter is present with tip terminating in the mid SVC. Small mediastinal lymph nodes are likely reactive. The thyroid gland is heterogeneous, and the right lobe appears diffusely enlarged. There is a new small pericardial effusion. There is persistent mild straightening of the interventricular septum with enlargement of the right ventricular cavity compared to the left, stable compared to the prior study. Bilateral pleural effusions are increased in size, now moderate. Emphysematous changes are noted, especially at the lung apices. There is complete collapse of the left lower lobe and partial collapse of the right lower lobe. Heterogeneity of this collapse may reflect atelectasis with patchy heterogeneity from superimposed infarction as this is in the area of prior emboli, though an infectious consolidation is also a consideration. Secretions are present above the ET tube balloon. ETT terminates in appropriate position, and the central airways are patent. An NG tube is present with tip terminating in the proximal stomach. Several simple cysts are again noted in the liver. The remainder of the visualized portion of the upper abdomen is unremarkable. No lytic or blastic osseous lesion suspicious for malignancy is identified.\n",
