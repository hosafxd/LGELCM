      "report": "FINDINGS: CHEST: There is good opacification of the central and segmental pulmonary artery segments, with somewhat suboptimal opacification of the subsegmental branches. However, there is no evidence of an acute pulmonary embolus. Visualized portions of the thyroid are normal, without evidence of a nodule or mass. Great vessel configuration is normal. The aortic arch is normal, with a normal sized ascending and descending thoracic aorta. There are no enlarged axillary, mediastinal, or hilar lymph nodes. Several small subcentimeter, but mildly prominent, lymph nodes are identified in the right paratracheal space, measuring up to 9 mm (3/175). Similarly, there are several mildly prominent subcarinal lymph nodes, measuring up to 9 mm (3/139). No discretely enlarged hilar lymph nodes are identified. Soft tissue density in the anterior mediastinum likely reflects residual thymus (3/177). Left central venous catheter terminates in the right atrium. There is massive cardiomegaly, with severe biventricular and biatrial enlargement (particularly left ventricle enlargement). The right ventricle and right atrium are also severely enlarged, and there is reflux of contrast into the IVC and hepatic veins. There is no pericardial effusion. There are no significant atherosclerotic coronary artery calcifications. The main pulmonary artery remains enlarged, measuring up to 39 mm in diameter. As before, there are patchy high density nodular foci in the right lower lobe and right upper lobe, reflecting prior aspiration of barium. In addition, similar to prior examination, there are large areas of mosaic attenuation in both lungs, particularly in the mid and lower lung zones, possibly reflecting underlying pulmonary hypertension. No significant interlobular septal thickening or fissural thickening is identified to definitively suggest pulmonary edema. No discrete nodule or mass is identified in either lung. For more details regarding the abdomen and pelvis, please see separately dictated examination. BONES: Bone mineralization appears normal. There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic foci. There is no acute fracture. IMPRESSION: 1. MILDLY LIMITED EXAMINATION, WITHOUT EVIDENCE OF PULMONARY EMBOLUS. 2. ENLARGED MAIN PULMONARY ARTERY (38 MM), SUGGESTING PULMONARY HYPERTENSION. ENLARGED RIGHT ATRIUM AND RIGHT VENTRICLE, AS WELL AS REFLUX OF CONTRAST INTO THE IVC HEPATIC VEINS, SUGGEST ELEVATED RIGHT HEART PRESSURES. MOSAIC ATTENUATION IN BOTH LUNGS LIKELY REFLECTS UNDERLYING PULMONARY HYPERTENSION. 3. MASSIVE CARDIOMEGALY. 4. NO EVIDENCE OF PNEUMONIA OR EDEMA. 5. THE FINAL REPORT IS CONCORDANT WITH THE PRELIMINARY REPORT PROVIDED BY THE OVERNIGHT RESIDENT IN PACS."

      "report": "FINDINGS: The thoracic aorta demonstrates normal contour and caliber, negative for dissection or disruption. There is conventional arch anatomy and the arch vessels are also normal in contour and caliber. There is no mediastinal hematoma. Heart is mildly enlarged. There is no pericardial effusion. No central pulmonary arterial filling defects are seen. There is no pathologic lymphadenopathy within the mediastinum, hila, or axilla. There are linear opacities within both lung bases, most likely representing atelectasis. An ill-defined focal opacity within the lingula likely represents additional atelectasis, although a small contusion is not entirely excluded. There is no pneumatocele. There is a 3 mm subpleural nodule in the right middle lobe (series 7, image 142). There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. There is a minimal anterior wedge compression deformity of the T9 vertebral body, of uncertain age. The thoracic osseous structures otherwise appear intact. Limited images of the upper abdomen are unremarkable. Addendum Begins 3D reformations consisting of curved and multiplanar reformations, maximum intensity projections, and volume rendered images were performed on an independent workstation and corroborate the findings. Addendum Ends IMPRESSION: 1. NO EVIDENCE FOR THORACIC VASCULAR INJURY OR PNEUMOTHORAX. 2. MILD ANTERIOR COMPRESSION WEDGE DEFORMITY OF T9 VERTEBRAL BODY, OF UNCERTAIN AGE. RECOMMEND CORRELATION FOR PAIN AT THIS LEVEL. 3. A NONSPECIFIC 3-MM RIGHT MIDDLE LOBE NODULE. RECOMMEND COMPARISON WITH ANY AVAILABLE OUTSIDE IMAGING. IF NONE AVAILABLE, RECOMMEND FOLLOW UP PER FLEISCHNER SOCIETY CRITERIA FOR INCIDENTAL PULMONARY NODULES LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO 4MM. LOW RISK PATIENTS: NO FOLLOW UP. HIGH RISK PATIENTS: 12 MONTH CT FOLLOW UP."

      "report": "FINDINGS: Evaluation of the pulmonary vasculature demonstrates no evidence of filling defects to suggest pulmonary emboli. Main pulmonary artery is at the upper limits of normal size. Right internal jugular dual-lumen catheter is in place with the tip in the proximal right atrium. Left internal jugular catheter is in place with the tip in the left innominate vein. Small subcutaneous hematoma is appreciated at the left internal jugular skin entry site. Thoracic aorta demonstrates normal contour and caliber with moderate atherosclerotic plaque. Four-vessel aortic arch is incidentally noted with the left vertebral artery arising directly from the aorta. Mild cardiomegaly is appreciated without evidence of pericardial effusion. Coronary artery calcifications are appreciated involving the left anterior descending and circumflex coronary arteries. Endotracheal tube is in place with the tip approximately 2.5 cm above the carina. Trachea and central bronchi otherwise patent. Multifocal areas of patchy ground glass are appreciated involving all lobes. Additional focal consolidation versus atelectasis is appreciated in bilateral lower lobes. No evidence of significant pleural effusions. Calcified left hilar lymph nodes and small calcified left pulmonary nodules identified, likely representing sequela of prior granulomatous process. Visualized thyroid gland is unremarkable. Scattered subcentimeter mediastinal lymph nodes are appreciated. No evidence of axillary or mediastinal lymphadenopathy by CT size criteria. NG tube is in place with the tip in the stomach. Limited evaluation of visualized upper abdominal organs in the pulmonary arterial phase imaging demonstrates no significant abnormalities. Degenerative changes are appreciated in the visualized cervical and thoracic spine. No suspicious osseous lesions are appreciated. IMPRESSION: 1.

No mediastinal, axillary, or hilar lymphadenopathy is present. The ascending aorta is normal in caliber. Bovine aortic arch anatomy is present. No surface irregularity is seen along thoracic aorta to suggest intimal flap, dissection, or atheromatous ulcer. Lack of noncontrast images limits ability to assess for intramural hematoma.
