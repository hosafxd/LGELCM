═══════════════════════════════════════════════════
FIELD DEFINITIONS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════

general_finding: The CLINICAL CATEGORY of what is being described.
  USE the clinical entity name, NOT the anatomical structure, NOT a generic category.

  CORRECT examples:
    "cardiomegaly", "pericardial effusion", "pulmonary embolus",
    "atherosclerotic plaque", "coronary artery calcification",
    "lymphadenopathy", "pleural effusion", "pneumothorax",
    "catheter", "endotracheal tube", "nasogastric tube",
    "hematoma", "fracture", "intramural hematoma",
    "lung parenchyma", "thyroid gland", "heart", "aorta",
    "thoracic aorta", "aortic arch", "pulmonary artery",
    "pulmonary arteries", "trachea", "central airways",
    "airways", "liver", "gallbladder", "bone",
    "lymph nodes", "pulmonary nodules", "pulmonary nodule",
    "soft tissue", "upper abdomen", "spine",
    "cholecystitis", "aortic pathology", "consolidation",
    "vertebral artery", "prior disease", "thyroid nodules",
    "great vessels", "upper abdominal organs"

  WRONG — never use generic categories like:
    ✗ "thyroid abnormality" → use "thyroid gland" or "thyroid nodules"
    ✗ "cardiac abnormality" → use "coronary artery calcification" or "heart"
    ✗ "vascular abnormality" → use "aorta", "pulmonary artery", etc.
    ✗ "parenchymal abnormality" → use "lung parenchyma" or "consolidation"
    ✗ "pleural abnormality" → use "pleural effusion" or "pneumothorax"
    ✗ "skeletal abnormality" → use "bone" or "fracture"
    ✗ "airway abnormality" → use "airways" or "trachea"
    ✗ "lymph node abnormality" → use "lymphadenopathy" or "lymph nodes"
    ✗ "liver lesion" → use "liver"
    ✗ "abdominal abnormality" → use "upper abdomen"

  For devices: general_finding = the device name itself:
    "catheter", "endotracheal tube", "nasogastric tube"

  For absent pathology: general_finding = the pathology name:
    "pericardial effusion" (not "pericardium" or "pericardial space")
    "pulmonary embolus" (not "pulmonary arteries")
    "cholecystitis" (not "gallbladder")
    "lymphadenopathy" (not "lymph nodes")
    "pneumothorax" (not "lungs")

specific_finding: The specific observation or descriptor.
  Use concise clinical terminology, not raw sentence fragments.
  CORRECT: "aberrant origin", "subcutaneous hematoma", "filling defects"
  WRONG: "left vertebral artery arising directly from the aorta" (too verbose)

location: Array of anatomical sites. ALWAYS populate when the report states a location.
  Include laterality. Include both insertion site AND tip position for devices.

degree: Array of qualifiers (mild, moderate, severe, small, focal, diffuse, patchy, etc.).
  Include descriptors like "suspicious", "significant", "bibasilar", "subcentimeter", "scattered".
  For unremarkable/normal findings, degree = ["unremarkable"] or ["normal"].
  Use empty array [] when no qualifiers apply. Never put "None" as a string inside the array.

measurement: Exact numeric value with units from text, or "None".

comparison: Only set if report compares to prior imaging. Otherwise "None".

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════
ENTITY GRANULARITY RULES
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════

RULE 1: ONE SENTENCE DESCRIBING ONE THING = ONE ENTITY
  Each distinct clinical observation gets its own entity.

RULE 2: SPLIT SEPARATE ANATOMICAL STRUCTURES
  "The aorta and great vessels are normal" = TWO entities:
    1. general_finding: "aorta", specific_finding: "aorta course and caliber"
    2. general_finding: "great vessels", specific_finding: "great vessels course and caliber"

  "Trachea and central bronchi are patent" = TWO entities:
    1. general_finding: "trachea", specific_finding: "patency"
    2. general_finding: "bronchi", specific_finding: "patency" (or "central airways"/"patency")

  "The trachea and central airways are patent" = TWO entities:
    1. general_finding: "trachea", specific_finding: "patency"
    2. general_finding: "central airways", specific_finding: "patency"

RULE 3: SPLIT SEPARATE CLINICAL FINDINGS ON SAME STRUCTURE
  "Heart is normal in size with a trace pericardial effusion" = TWO entities:
    1. general_finding: "heart", specific_finding: "heart size", degree: ["normal"]
    2. general_finding: "pericardial effusion", specific_finding: "pericardial effusion", degree: ["trace"]

  "Normal contour and caliber with moderate atherosclerotic plaque" = TWO entities:
    1. Contour/caliber entity
    2. Atherosclerotic plaque entity

  "Thyroid gland is heterogeneous with multiple small nodules in the right lobe" = TWO entities:
    1. general_finding: "thyroid gland", specific_finding: "heterogeneous thyroid", degree: ["heterogeneous"]
    2. general_finding: "thyroid nodules", specific_finding: "nodules", location: ["right thyroid lobe"], degree: ["multiple", "small"]

RULE 4: SEPARATE ABSENT PATHOLOGY FROM RELATED ABSENT PATHOLOGY
  "No surface irregularity to suggest intimal flap, dissection, or atheromatous ulcer"
  = TWO entities:
    1. general_finding: "thoracic aorta", specific_finding: "surface irregularity", finding_presence: "absent"
    2. general_finding: "aortic pathology", specific_finding: "intimal flap, dissection, or atheromatous ulcer", finding_presence: "absent"

RULE 5: MERGE — DEVICES
  Merge device insertion site + tip position into ONE entity with multi-location array.
  "Catheter in right IJ with tip in right atrium" → location: ["right internal jugular", "proximal right atrium"]

RULE 6: MERGE — GROUPED NEGATIVES (same clinical domain)
  "No focal consolidation, effusion or edema" → ONE entity:
    general_finding: "lung parenchyma", specific_finding: "consolidation, effusion, or edema", finding_presence: "absent"
  Include applicable qualifiers: degree: ["focal"]

RULE 7: MERGE — VERSUS / AND/OR STATEMENTS
  "consolidation versus atelectasis" or "atelectasis and/or scarring" → ONE entity:
    finding_presence: "uncertain"
    Keep wording: specific_finding: "consolidation versus atelectasis"

RULE 8: MERGE — COREFERENCES
  "Ground glass opacities are seen. These involve all lobes." → ONE entity

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════
IMPRESSION HANDLING
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════

- If IMPRESSION restates a FINDINGS entity with same information → extract ONLY ONCE (use FINDINGS version)
- If IMPRESSION adds new clinical significance → merge into the existing entity's degree
- Do NOT extract IMPRESSION-only summary statements that are not specific findings
  Example: "NO ACUTE VASCULAR INJURY" → Do NOT extract this as a separate entity (it's a summary)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════
FINDING PRESENCE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════

present: "is seen", "demonstrates", "present", "identified", "noted", "appreciated"
absent: "no", "without", "absent", "no evidence of", "negative for"
uncertain: "versus", "and/or", "possible", "suspicious for", "cannot exclude", "may represent"

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════
SPECIAL CASES
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════

NORMAL/UNREMARKABLE: Extract with finding_presence: "present", degree: ["unremarkable"] or ["normal"]
  "thyroid gland is unremarkable" → general_finding: "thyroid gland", degree: ["unremarkable"]
  "upper abdomen is unremarkable" → general_finding: "upper abdomen", degree: ["unremarkable"]

DEVICES: general_finding = device name. Location = [insertion site, tip position]. Measurement = distance if stated.
  "ET tube tip 2.5 cm above carina" → measurement: "2.5 cm above the carina"

SEQUELAE: Extract as separate entity.
  "calcified nodules, likely sequela of prior granulomatous process" → TWO entities:
    1. The calcified nodules
    2. general_finding: "prior disease", specific_finding: "sequela of prior granulomatous process"

LYMPH NODES:
  "no lymphadenopathy" → general_finding: "lymphadenopathy", finding_presence: "absent"
  "subcentimeter nodes present" → general_finding: "lymph nodes", finding_presence: "present", degree: ["subcentimeter"]
  Only extract lymphadenopathy as present if: "enlarged", "prominent", "pathologic"

LIMITED ASSESSMENT:
  "Lack of noncontrast images limits ability to assess for intramural hematoma"
  → general_finding: "intramural hematoma", finding_presence: "uncertain"

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════
COMMON ERRORS TO AVOID
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════

✗ Using generic categories ("vascular abnormality") instead of specific clinical terms
✗ Merging separate anatomical structures into one entity (trachea + bronchi, aorta + great vessels)
✗ Merging separate clinical findings on the same structure (heart size + pericardial effusion)
✗ Missing the heart size entity when it's stated
✗ Missing the pericardial effusion entity when it's stated (even if absent)
✗ Extracting IMPRESSION-only summary lines as new entities
✗ Leaving location empty when the report specifies a location
✗ Putting "None" as a string inside degree array (use empty [] instead)
✗ Missing qualifiers like "significant", "scattered", "bibasilar" in degree
✗ Using raw sentence fragments as specific_finding instead of concise terms
