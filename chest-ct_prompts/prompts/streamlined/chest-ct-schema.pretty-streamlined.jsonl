  "report": "FINDINGS: Evaluation of the pulmonary vasculature demonstrates no evidence of filling defects to suggest pulmonary emboli. Main pulmonary artery is at the upper limits of normal size. Right internal jugular dual-lumen catheter is in place with the tip in the proximal right atrium. Left internal jugular catheter is in place with the tip in the left innominate vein. Small subcutaneous hematoma is appreciated at the left internal jugular skin entry site. Thoracic aorta demonstrates normal contour and caliber with moderate atherosclerotic plaque. Four-vessel aortic arch is incidentally noted with the left vertebral artery arising directly from the aorta. Mild cardiomegaly is appreciated without evidence of pericardial effusion. Coronary artery calcifications are appreciated involving the left anterior descending and circumflex coronary arteries. Endotracheal tube is in place with the tip approximately 2.5 cm above the carina. Trachea and central bronchi otherwise patent. Multifocal areas of patchy ground glass are appreciated involving all lobes. Additional focal consolidation versus atelectasis is appreciated in bilateral lower lobes. No evidence of significant pleural effusions. Calcified left hilar lymph nodes and small calcified left pulmonary nodules identified, likely representing sequela of prior granulomatous process. Visualized thyroid gland is unremarkable. Scattered subcentimeter mediastinal lymph nodes are appreciated. No evidence of axillary or mediastinal lymphadenopathy by CT size criteria. NG tube is in place with the tip in the stomach. Limited evaluation of visualized upper abdominal organs in the pulmonary arterial phase imaging demonstrates no significant abnormalities. Degenerative changes are appreciated in the visualized cervical and thoracic spine. No suspicious osseous lesions are appreciated. IMPRESSION: 1. NO EVIDENCE OF PULMONARY EMBOLISM AS CLINICALLY QUERIED. 2. PATCHY BILATERAL GROUNDGLASS OPACITIES INVOLVING ALL PULMONARY LOBES CONCERNING FOR ASPIRATION VERSES MULTIFOCAL INFECTION. ADDITIONAL BILATERAL LOWER LOBE CONSOLIDATION VERSUS ATELECTASIS. 3. PRELIMINARY REPORT GENERATED BY RADIOLOGIST ON CALL Conor, MD ON May 2016 0438 HRS.",

  "report": "FINDINGS: The thyroid gland is heterogeneous with multiple small nodules seen in the right lobe. The heart size is normal without a pericardial effusion. Although this was a non-gated examination, moderate to severe coronary arterial calcification is noted of the LAD and proximal circumflex vessels. The aorta and great vessels are normal in course and caliber. The main pulmonary artery is normal in course and caliber. While not a dedicated pulmonary embolism study, no filling defects are seen in the main or lobar pulmonary arteries to suggest pulmonary embolism. The lungs demonstrate bibasilar atelectasis and / or scarring. No focal consolidations or pleural effusions. No pneumothorax. An 8mm subpleural cyst is present in the right lower lobe (Series 3, Image 132) A 3 mm pulmonary nodule is seen in the right upper lobe (Series 3, Image 117). The airways are patent and of normal course and caliber. No mediastinal, hilar or axillary lymphadenopathy. A bilobed soft tissue lesion of uncertain etiology is seen adjacent to the distal esophagus measuring 4.2 x 2.2 cm. Limited evaluation of the upper abdomen is unremarkable. No suspicious bony lesions identified. A fracture is present the distal left second rib extending into the costochondral junction. Addendum Begins 3D reformations consisting of curved and multiplanar reformations, maximum intensity projections, and volume rendered images were performed on an independent workstation and corroborate the findings. Addendum Ends IMPRESSION: 1. NO ACUTE VASCULAR INJURY. 2. LEFT SECOND RIB FRACTURE AT THE COSTOCHONDRAL JUNCTION. 3. NONSPECIFIC BILOBED SOFT TISSUE LESION ABUTTING THE ESOPHAGUS MEASURING 4.2 x 2.2 CM (CC x TRV) OF UNCLEAR ETIOLOGY. A LESION IN THIS LOCATION COULD POTENTIALLY ARISE FROM THE ESOPHAGUS, OR AS ADENOPATHY FROM AN ABDOMINAL OR RETROPERITONEAL SOURCE. FINDINGS DISCUSSED WITH dr. villegas, TRAUMA, AT 1315 HOURS.",
